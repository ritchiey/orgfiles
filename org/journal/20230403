* Monday, 03/04/2023
** First day of semi-retirement (3 days per week). I work Tuesday to Thursday now.
** Started using OrgMode Journal
** Bought the kids coffee at Coffee Club. Didn't join Stella at Laika because Brad has Covid.
** Finished wheelie bin worm farm and added worms from multi-level worm farm
** Amy cut my hair so I'd look good for passport photo.
** Submitted passport application at post-office. About $350 with photos.
** Bought Ryobi Articulating multi-tool. Matty came with me to Bunnings to get it. Reall like that tool. Stored it and its accessories in a protein powder jar in the shed.
** Australian Super said my appeal for NOI was past the legal cut-off date. I forwarded it to Rhett. Probably have to give up on that.
** Talked to Dan at the park about John Wick 4 (which we saw last night). He said that The Wire is a good show but the pilot episode was a bit lame.
** Poked my left eye with a sharp leaf when I was setting the worm farm in position. It's still a little sore.
** Amy ordered another robot vacuum so that we've got one for each level
** Amy made a beautiful Mango Salad. Sweet and savoury and delicious.
** Thoughts
*** Need to get very comfortable with OrgMode and journal every days
*** Need to sync OrgMode files somehow. Once that's done, I can use it at work.
*** Because I'm using OrgMode with Doom Emacs, I may as well make that my Clojure environment
*** A wheelie bin could be made into a simple robot by adding an extra wheel at the front (R2D2)
*** I should try NextJournal Clerk because it might be good for literate programming with Clojure and conducting experiments
*** I really want to learn Babashka and use Clojure for everything
*** Any business we setup, we need to account for how we take holidays. Don't want to be tied down.
**** Maybe have a partner and don't take holidays at the same time
